# Photometry of EPIC-{{ epic }}
# 
# Description
# 
#     This photometry was produced by Erik Petigura using the `k2phot`
#     code. We used a stationary {{ npix }} pixel aperture to construct
#     simple aperture photometry from the K2 target pixel file. Pixels
#     included in the aperture are shown in the associated plot. We then
#     modeled time- and position-dependent photometric variability. The
#     size and shape of the aperture was chosen to minimize noise on
#     three-hour timescales.
